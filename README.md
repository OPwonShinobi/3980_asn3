# GPS Console application in python using the gps3 library

This program was written to be run on a Rasberry Pi running the Raspbian OS, but should work on other unix installations that supports gps3. 

How to run
----------
This project was written in Python 3. Inside the src code folder, the main script body can be called via: py 3 dcgps.py . It'll warn if any librarys are not installed.

Although this is a python project, the requirements at the time asked for a raspbian executable. As such, an executable with the python interpreter is included, and only runs on raspbian.
